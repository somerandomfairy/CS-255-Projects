# Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The client of the project is DriverPass, a company that aims to provide training to help prospective drivers pass their driving exams. The goal of the client is to design and implement a system that allows users to take online classes, complete practice tests, and schedule on-the-road training sessions.
# What did you do particularly well?
One thing I feel like I did well was documenting the system requirements and designs clearly and comprehensively. I also think that the UML diagrams visualize system interactions that ensure the representation of the core requirements of the client.
# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
One thing from my work that I would revise is the UML diagrams. While I feel like I covered the core functionality, the diagrams themselves were rather bare-bones and did not contain a lot of details. To improve on this, I would explore more in-depth how different components and actors interact with the system.
# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
To interpret user needs, I analyzed the client's requirements from the interview transcript and then translated them into functional and non-functional requirements. This allowed me to understand the essential features of the system. It is important to consider the user's needs when designing as otherwise the product may not align with user requirements, resulting in unsatisfied customers.
# How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
Working on the projects has given me a chance to practice designing software with an approach that involves requirement analysis and diagramming. By using UML diagrams and structured documentation, I was able to create a blueprint based on the client's requirements. In future projects, I would apply what I learned in this course to analyze and design a system.
